          <h1>Colorado Voter Service and Polling Center Siting Tool</h1>

          <p>
              Developed by the Center for Inclusive Democracy (CID) at the University of Southern California, this interactive web-based mapping tool is designed to assist Colorado elections offices in the state’s sixteen most populous counties. CID will soon expand the Siting Tool to all counties in the state. Encompassing all legislated siting criteria, the Voter Service and Polling Center Siting Tool will aid election officials in the VSPC siting process by producing suggested VSPC location areas for a half-mile grid.

              This new user-friendly web-based mapping tool identifies areas where VSPCs and drop boxes would likely have the most success serving voters. This tool will input all legislated criteria and demographic data to produce suggested locations on a half-mile grid. Colorado county clerks using their local knowledge will then be able to find specific locations for consideration in these areas.

            <h1>About The Tool</h1>

            <p>
              The Voting Location Siting Tool aids election officials in the siting process by producing optimal voting locations and ballot drop boxes for half-mile grid squares across the county. Election officials are able to find specific locations for consideration in these areas using local knowledge of their county’s resources and needs. The Siting Tool also provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level in each of the 16 counties.
            </p>
            <p>
              CID has released multiple types of community-level demographic and voter data, each viewable in separate interactive maps. Communities can immediately begin using this data to start identifying voting locations or to conduct voter outreach.
