  <h1>VSPC Site Security</h1>

  <p>According to the Colorado Secretary of State's office, county elections offices should consider the following questions when deciding on VSPC locations:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Does the site have enough space to keep monitors with sensitive information out of view from the public?</li>
    <li>How will you connect securely to SCORE if using this site?</li>
    <li>Will this site allow you to adequately control access into and out of the building or room that voting equipment is located in?</li>
  </ol>
